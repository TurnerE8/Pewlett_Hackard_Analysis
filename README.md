# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

##Overview 

The purpose of this module challenge is to help one of the managers at Pewlett-Hackard determine how many employees will be retiring in the near future. We have to 1) determine the number of employees eligible for retirement per title and 2) figure out how many of these employees can participate in the mentorship program. This analysis will help the company prepare for the coming "silver tsunami". 

##Results 

Pewlett Hackard has a total of 300,024 employees. Nearly 73, 000 of these employees are eligible for retirement - meaning the company is at risk of losing nearly 24% of its workforce over the next several years. 

Of the retiring titles, basically 50,000 of these titles are held by either Senior Staff or Senior Engineers. This is signficant because they are at risk of losing senior leadership positions AND losing their technically proficient leaders within the engineering department. 

##Additional Queries for the Way Forward

There are two queries I would be interested in conducting to paint a better picture for the company. 

1. How many of the 73,000 employees actually plan to retire in the next 1-3 years? I think this would give us an accurate measure of the real risk and what risk the company may be assuming. 

2. How many of the Senior Staff and Senior Engineers have identified their potential back-fills? I believe this would give a good measurement of how much recruiting and talent acquisition they can expect to need while also attempting to keep the promotions within company ranks.
